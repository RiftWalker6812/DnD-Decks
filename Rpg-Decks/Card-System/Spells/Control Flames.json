  "CardName": "Control Flames",
  "Description": "<p>You choose nonmagical flame that you can see within Range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You affect it in one of the following ways:</p><p>- You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location.</p><p>- You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.</p><p>- You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour.</p><p>- You cause simple shapes-such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location-to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour.</p><p>If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.</p>",
