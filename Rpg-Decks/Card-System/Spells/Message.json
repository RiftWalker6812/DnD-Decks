  "Description": "<p>You point your finger toward a creature within Range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.</p><p>You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesnâ€™t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.</p>",
