  "CardName": "Sleet Storm",
  "Description": "<p>Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within Range. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.</p><p>The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone.</p><p>If a creature is concentrating in the spell’s area, the creature must make a successful constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose Concentration.</p>",
